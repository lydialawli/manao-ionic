# PLAY MANAO

Play Manao is a cross platform mobile app that provides a growing list of **interactive games in the real world** for everyone to join and play.

The games are **free** for everyone.

## How to play?

The player will need to get to the starting point to be allowed to start playing.

Games are divided into **paths**. Each path **poses a challenge** that the player needs to figure out, very often having to observe around where he/she is located. It can be a quiz, a puzzle...

**Once a challenge is solved**, the next path is **unlocked** and indications will lead the player to the next path.

When all the paths are opened, the game is over. The total score of the player will display then, and joined to the global leaderboard.

## Create a game

This is a key feature of Play Manao yet it is still under development.

The idea is there will be the ability to create one's own game. The platform would provide some easy and intuitive set of tools to make it happen. Like making a form, same same but different :)

Be a **player** or a **creator**. Join the community by making your own game or sharing the ones you like to play!

## Road map

We are aiming to launch the first version to the market by the end of this year.
A list of improvements will happen before then.
